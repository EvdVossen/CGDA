Description: This package is able to process multiple Continuous Glucose Monitoring inputs with different commonly used metrics (mg/dL and mmol/L). The CGDA package contains one main function called "cganalysis" in which the function loops through the input directory containing CGM data files and produces a table containing summary measures. Several Besides the summary measures, plots are also created. The function always produces three figures containing the aggregate LOESS smoothing curve of all data, as well as the same plot showing the measurement points colored by the time-in-range according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA). Lastly, a plot containing an average glucose curve of multiple subjects. If interpolation is done, a plot is created showing the amount of interpolated data. When groups are defined, multiple plots are created; one barplot showing time-in-range according to the ADA, and another plot showing the LOESS smoothing curve of the groups. Note that this package is forked from the open-source package cgmanalysis available at <https://github.com/childhealthbiostatscore/R-Packages/>.
